# Monte Carlo single and multithread Java implementation

This is a small project we had to make for a Java assignment during my studies.

## You will find
* A simple GUI for using the algorithm (used as view and controller, please forgive the mess)
* A single-threaded implementation
* A multi-threaded implementation using Java's Executors and Callables

## How to
Open the project in your favorite IDE then build and run MonteCarloSingleThread or MonteCarloMultiThread depending on which implementation you want to use.
